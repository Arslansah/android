Megalodon is a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-android">official Mastodon Android app</a> adding important features that are missing in the official app, such as the federated timeline, unlisted posting and an image description viewer.

<b>Key features</b>

- <b>Unlisted posting</b>: Post publicly without having your post show up in trends, hashtags or public timelines.
- <b>Federated timeline</b>: See all public posts from people on all other Fediverse neighborhoods your home instance is connected to.
- <b>Custom timelines</b>: Pin any list or hashtag to your Megalodon’s home tab to simply swipe between your favorite topics and people!
- <b>Drafts and scheduled posts</b>: Allows for preparing a post and scheduling it to send it automatically at a specific time.
- <b>Answering follow requests</b>: Accept or decline follow requests from your notifications or the dedicated Follow requests list.
- <b>Delete and re-draft</b>: The much-loved feature that made editing possible without an actual editing function.
- <b>Post visibility indicator</b>: When opening or replying to a post, a handy icon indicating the post’s visibility will be displayed.
- <b>Color themes</b>: Should you not like the default Pink color them (the shark is silently judging you), Moshidon’s color themes got you covered.
- <b>Better compatibility</b>: For those of use who are on Glitch or Akkoma servers, Megalodon provides various extra features and improvements.
