## F.A.Q

Q: What are the main differences between Moshidon and Megalodon?

A: There are many, but the most outstanding differences are: the ability to have other server's local timeline inside the app. It can be acessed in the "Add community" option in the top right corner of the Edit timelines screen. Other outstanding features that Moshidon has are some quality of life improvements, such as notification actions and allowing for unlisted replies by default.  Most other features are pretty minor, such as profile notes directly available in the person's profile. Other features are quite minor usability and visibility improvements. All of which can be found in the settings page. 

Q: Will there ever be a version of Moshidon for iOS? 

A: No. As android and iOS apps do not share code, it is incredibly hard to port.
